"""
The main class for our imager application.

This modules contains a single class.  Instances of this class support an edit history.
An edit history keeps track of all modifications of an original history.  It allows for 
(step-by-step) undos of any changes.

    A class that keeps track of edits from an original image.
    
    This class is what allows us to implement the Undo functionality in our application.
    The attribute _history stores all of the edits (up to a maximum of MAX_HISTORY edits)
    in order.  So the last element of _history is the most recent edit.
